`npm start` - This will trigger parcel to run the project.

# Underdtanding the Project

## Client side

The client-side app uses React-Fn. A functional approach to React that I built as an alternative to Redux style actions. _A similar approach to something like Hyperapp_.

The Project running on local is expected to be run with parcel.js.

The project is written in typescript.

## Server side
